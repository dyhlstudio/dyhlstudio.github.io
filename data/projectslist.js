            "Roughly one semester into architecture school, I began to ask myself more and more what is and isn't architecture. Many people seem to have particular ideas of what architecture is, and I often find myself a bit annoyed or even dissatisfied with their definitions which are more often than not, somewhat restrictive. This semester has become about critiquing and challenging that notion, and poking fun at the narrow behaviors and traditions that architects have."

As food deserts, sea level rise and gentrification threaten Inwood's communities, these sky farms reposition the neighborhood as a critical node within New York's food landscape through large-scale production and distribution and grassroots community and mutual aid efforts.",
            "Farming occurs on plinths raised above future floodplains. 1:4 constructions of a tectonic system resulted in three types of casted pieces which can create various soil beds, apertures, channels, and light wells. The plinth coexists with towers that house distribution facilities, community kitchens and pantries, greenhouses, and composting areas."

Inspired by the playscapes of Isamu Noguchi, this project reinterprets the concept of playground as, quite simply, an interconnected network of surfaces. The catalog features a kit-of-parts based on a sectional logic of elevation and grade as conditions of possible human interaction.",

The concoctions made at Draft reflect this spirit of playful, but also intentional experimentation. Several menus offer a variety of drinks crafted for a time of day and through common bases such as milk, tea, wine, juice, etc., while the signature Draft mixing glass offers a visual guide to common volumes."

            "Endorphinia is the first short film I made of the competitive FPS game, Blacklight: Retribution. Informally known as frag movies, these films involve a collection of clips which are edited together through montaging techniques. The editing is mostly focused on balancing montaging techniques while keeping a general narrative intact. The film is a collection of my own recordings and footage."

            "Against the Grain is a guitarmaking and prototyping project in collaboration with a Dallas-based luthier: Frank Teng of Falcon Tone Design. The guitar features a smaller, thinner, and lighter than average guitar body to fit smaller players and particularly for playing while standing up. Aside from a pre-fabricated neck, most of the guitar is custom-made to be more accessible to most players in weight, size, and bulk.",
