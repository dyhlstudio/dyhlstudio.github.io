            "Psychogeocairn is an installation and participatory art piece that draws upon the psychogeographic practices of the avant-garde Situationist International of the 1960s to prompt questions about spaces and how we inhabit them. Through prompting participants with the “lost art” of drawing maps, the project makes visible the relationships and contexts of New York City’s inhabitants in both analogue and digital perspectives.",
            "The installation, through the physical act of drawing and thinking about spaces and visuals, responds to the problem of “narrowness,” or unknowingly being stuck in routine, by revealing how our movements and inhabitation of spaces is influenced. Through this responsive act of reflection, we can learn to read and reinterpret our understandings of the urban fabric.",

As its name implies, Project Memo is a tool for recording work-related messages, but organized through the ability to  spray paint in both “work” and “play” modes onto one’s real surroundings mapped by the HoloLens, and attach virtual communications onto painted works that are shared between users.",

            "Draft is a brand concept for an experimental drinks bar focused on redefining what we consider drinks and how we consume them. Operating somewhere between a café, teahouse and bar, Draft's mixologies seek to bridge these spaces that are often separate together by creating \"drafts\" that do not belong solely to a café, juice bar, tavern, etc. In doing so, Draft also operates as a unique environment for social and cultural traffic.",
            "For the Draft brand, an omnipresent blue-and-white theme and graphic linework draws from blueprints, schematics, and the creative energies associated with their use. The concoctions made at Draft reflect this spirit of playful, but also intentional experimentation. Several menus offer a variety of drinks crafted for a time of day and through common bases such as milk, tea, wine, juice, etc., while the signature Draft mixing glass offers a visual guide to common volumes."

As both a linear narrative film and non-linear montage, the film’s surreal and realistic visuals emphasis viscerality and unconscious emotions, drawing from works from filmmakers such as David Lynch, Wes Anderson, Maya Derin, and Yoko Ono. The janggu, a traditional Korean folk drum, highlights an importance of rhythm and sound in the portrayal of such spaces."
