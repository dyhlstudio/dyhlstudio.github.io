            "In 1907, New York City began constructing the Ashokan Reservoir. Determined to be among the city's largest bodies of water, the 255-square mile reservoir holds 123 billion gallons of water and serves potable water to 40% of the city's population. The cost, however, is the disposession of 12 towns, 504 homes, 35 stores, 10 churches, 10 schools, 9 blacksmiths, 7 sawmills, a gristmill, 2000 people, & 3000 graves from fertile Catskill valley lands. Mirroring a similar reappropriation of Esopus Munsee tribes' land by Dutch & English settlers in the 1600s, this act of dispossession left scars throughout the region that have yet to heal.",
            "In fact, to circumvent the building of a $6 billion water filtration plant mandated by the US Government, the city established the NYCDEP: a police agency dedicated to ensuring purity of the water. For the rural towns that border the massive reservoir, city control has resulted in increased rent, economic distress, & displacement of the current descendants of those dispossessed in 1907 as the city continues to buy more land.",
            "On February 17, 2023, our studio gathered at the Olive Free Library in West Shokan (a hamlet of Olive, NY) with several Olive residents to learn first-hand of its history. In talking to them, we discovered complicated histories of loss, resistance, survival & commoning strategies that connect the reservoir community to each other.",
            "The consequent research at once explores strategies to sustain the “commons” from multi-scale design interventions centered around a proposed bus route that provides accessibility & mobility. But here unlike in more urban manifestations, the commons is not built through public parks, community buildings, & centralized forums of gathering. The research establishes the rural commons through embracing patchwork & decentralized networks of connection found in communities like Olive, in which one third of the population is over the age of 60, nearly everyone is working, & multiple cars are needed for basic day-to-day life. It also embraces moments of non-urban gathering, such as the converging of dispersed townsfolk throughout the day, in their individual cars, to the house in West Shokan where a husband and wife sell duck eggs at an unmanned stand along the road. Because while the couple must go to work, moments of connection like this are evidence of built trust & social capital in the community that allow for the community to reap the long-term benefits of the duck egg stand.",
            "Abstract mappings & collages that reveal the historical narratives surrouding the Ashokan Reservoir & ask “what exactly are the commons?” Precise site analysis expose opportunities for the rudimentary beginnings of critical “toolkits,” such as establishing the bus route & bus stop as a reliable, accessible mode of getting around & extensions of the house which allow for secondary streams of income & bolster the dispersed, car-driven economy. This research, in its early phases, seeks to establish a form for the rural commons that is decentralized, dispersed, & thus delayed."

            "GSAPP Worm is one of three inflatable charging stations created through The Outside In Project seminar course, led by Galia Solomonoff and Laurie Hawkinson. The project and course focus on developing a pavilion design from initial ideation and design through to installation. The inflatable pavilion is a charging station and gathering space for students, faculty, graduates, and the Columbia University community. The chargers are powered by photovoltaic panels designed to support phones, small devices, and timed LED lights within the inflatable itself. The pipe-like open design accounts fosters meandering through the space, with crevices and sheltered moments for sitting, lying down, socializing, or napping. 180gr/m² polyester fabric inflated through blowers encouraged an exploration of gaseous geometries: round tubes and ribs in place of hard corners and edges. Early concepts demonstrate a progressive learning of the inflatable logic, which is carried through to design, structure, electrical installation, and maintenance.",
            "PV and electrical integration were of particular importance to the heart of the project. While fabrication and structural considerations were handled largely by external vendors and consultants, integration of the PV system presented many more opportunities for systems thinking, design for assembly and disassembly, and design development. The WORM's photovoltaic and LED system was disassembled in 15 minutes, compared to 1-hour for other inflatables, despite also being the only of the three inflatables to support a more complex dual battery-system. In considering construction ecology and economy of how to most efficiently and reliably install the PV system, PV-specific construction documents were prepared that could also act as cheat sheets or user guides for wiring and installing the electrical system for a variety of situations such as charging or testing the batteries, wiring order for assembly, and wiring order for disassembly in order to allow more effective coordination between different builders.",
            "From our experiences with Case One, our team was able to refine the scope of work and methodology with Case Two. This case tackled the issue of youth disconnection and social isolation within segregated communities such as the Patterson Houses. Though home to more permanent communities, public housing projects like the Patterson Houses are informally understood as areas which suffer from extremely low quality-of-life, economic and social opportunity, and high records of crime and policing. Our focus became on youth disconnection as a barometer for community prosperity, as education often serves as an opportunity for socio-economic mobility, while the lack of educational opportunities can actually hinder independence, earnings, and health and well-being in the long term. A combination of city-wide bivariate cloropleth maps connected by narrative \"one-liners\" weaved together these myriad factors and consequences of youth disconnection including race, educational attainment, poverty, arrests, and shootings in the final video presented to the court. Lastly, we created supplementary aerial footage and imagery that helped visualize basic, yet critical information about the case at hand.",

            "This project was conducted as a joint collaboration between Columbia GSAPP's Center for Spatial Research and 501(c)(3) nonprofit, The Legal Aid Society to incorporate GIS cartography into The Legal Aid Society's video advocacy work. The CSR team of architecture, urban design, and computational design students (led by Laura Kurgan) conducted research on the history of mass incarceration in the US and the strategies through which it manifests within urban centers such as New York City. Through two case studies given to us by The Legal Aid Society, our team came up with strategies to visually and thematically represent lack of access to opportunities and racial/economic disparities in order to humanize clients and to advocate for leniency in court proceedings and sentences through video scripting, animation, and direction.",
            "Case One dealt with the issue of unstable housing within New York City's temporary shelter system. The geospatial research explored how the frequent need to relocate homes, change schools, and uproot one's life can pose serious challenges to adolescent development, social integration, and mental and physical health, especially for low-income and BIPOC communities. However, beyond simply understanding that wide swaths of these populations suffer from these issues, our approach to these geonarratives required us to pinpoint novel perspectives for visualizing this information. In order to map the \"chaos\" of unstable housing, we focused on a striking aspect of the case: that many shelters often lack adequate access to basic utilities such as broadband internet, which in turn can prevent them from being able to attend school, do homework, or access critical resources such as scholarships, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through exploring this throughline of internet access, we integrated this quantitative GIS data analysis with interviews conducted by the legal team to create a more relatable, human-centered narrative.",

            "Located on a narrow triangular site surrounded by highways and industrial sites, the landscape scale creates a space of environmental refuge. A planted berm connects the street to the ground level, absorbs flooding runoff, and softens the landscape to create a more livable zone. Tree planting will help to filter toxic particulate matter, and wetland restoration near the waterfront serves to counteract future sea-level rise.",
            "The building scale emphasizes social cohesion by bringing together private residents and the broader public. Operable enclosures and wet walls regulate the movement of air and water for a public bathhouse program that integrates the building with the landscape.",
            "At the unit scale, an oversized corridor connects the private dwellings through shared common spaces for work and play. Three different systems of enclosures (solid walls, sliding glass doors, and polycarbonate sliding doors) create different amounts of openness to air, light, water, and publicness."

            "Strata School is a K-8 public school that teaches students how to live justly in the Anthropocene through academic study, play and work. Students become involved in the school’s operations and “home economics” with the guidance of faculty, staff, and PTA volunteers, in which they learn about their own agency as individuals and members of a community.",
            "The school encourages these pedagogical goals through an interconnected matrix of classroom “blocks.” Following phases of construction, parts of the school are incrementally built and occupiable at different stages. Built using site-derived earthen material, oblique terrains and interiors accommodate the plastic needs of children to fidget, hide, explode, and introspect. Classrooms flow horizontally to promote a mixing of different age ranges. Meanwhile, the mass and interiority found in lower levels dissipate into more open, porous spaces at the upper levels to accommodate programmatic needs from enclosed, safe retreats to open playscapes.",
            "Through the school's environments, social ecologies and its upkeep, children develop a more robust sense of agency about themselves and their surroundings."

The festival brings together artists, musicians, and technologists from around the world to the Merriweather Post Pavilion venue for a gathering of pioneering and groundbreaking art and sound in the forests of Symphony Woods. Throughout the night, visitors experience artworks and performances about new realities, perspectives, and wonder.",

            "Draft is a brand concept for an experimental drinks bar focused on redefining what we consider drinks and how we consume them. Operating somewhere between a café, teahouse and bar, Draft's mixologies seek to bridge these spaces that are often separate together by creating \"drafts\" that do not belong solely to a café, juice bar, tavern, etc. In doing so, Draft also operates as a unique environment for social and cultural traffic.",
            "For the Draft brand, an omnipresent blue-and-white theme and graphic linework draws from blueprints, schematics, and the creative energies associated with their use. The concoctions made at Draft reflect this spirit of playful, but also intentional experimentation. Several menus offer a variety of drinks crafted for a time of day and through common bases such as milk, tea, wine, juice, etc., while the signature Draft mixing glass offers a visual guide to common volumes."

            "Undergrowth is a short film exploring experimental storytelling about dream spaces and the feeling of dreaming. As both a linear narrative film and non-linear montage, the film’s surreal and realistic visuals emphasis viscerality and unconscious emotions, drawing from works from filmmakers such as David Lynch, Wes Anderson, Maya Derin, and Yoko Ono. The janggu, a traditional Korean folk drum, highlights an importance of rhythm and sound in the portrayal of such spaces."

Aside from a pre-fabricated neck, most of the guitar is custom-made to be more accessible to most players in weight, size, and bulk.",

This semester has become about critiquing and challenging that notion, and poking fun at the narrow behaviors and traditions that architects have."
